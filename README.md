# Example Python Weather Project
This repo contains an example of one way to solve the Python Weather project for the She Codes Plus Python unit.

Keep in mind that what's set out here is not intended to show the only way to solve this project, or even the recommended way to solve it. If every Python mentor demonstrated their own preferred solution to the project, each one would be different. Python lets us build our own solutions to problems any way we like, and if your project passed all the tests, then you were successful! (In fact, the point was to practice, so any solid attempt was a success, even if you didn't get all the tests passing within the time limit.)

Instead, this repo is designed to demonstrate some common Python idioms that you might not have had time to research within the (very tight!) project deadline.

For this reason, don't be discouraged if this example solution looks foreign to you or is hard to understand! Being a programmer is a constant journey of learning new techniques. We have plenty of documentation linked in the comments of this solution, and you are encouraged to approach the mentors or post in the help channels to help you interpret and apply the techniques set out here.
